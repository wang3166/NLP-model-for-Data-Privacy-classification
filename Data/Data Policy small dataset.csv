How We Share Your Information
We do not sell your personal information. To make the Lyft Platform work, we may need to share your personal information with other users, third parties, and service providers. This section explains when and why we share your information.

A. Sharing Between Lyft Users
Riders and Drivers.

Rider information shared with Driver: Upon receiving a ride request, we share with the Driver the Riderï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s pickup location, name, profile photo, rating, Rider statistics (like approximate number of rides and years as a Rider), and information the Rider includes in their Rider profile (like preferred pronouns). Upon pickup and during the ride, we share with the Driver the Riderï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s destination and any additional stops the Rider inputs into the Lyft app. Once the ride is finished, we also eventually share the Riderï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s rating and feedback with the Driver. (We remove the Riderï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s identity associated with ratings and feedback when we share it with Drivers, but a Driver may be able to identify the Rider that provided the rating or feedback.)

Driver information shared with Rider: Upon a D, we will share with the Rider the Driverï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s name, profile photo, preferred pronouns, rating, real-time location, and the vehicle make, model, color, and license plate, as well as other information in the Driverï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s Lyft profile, such as information Drivers choose to add (like country flag and why you drive) and Driver statistics (like approximate number of rides and years as a Driver).

Although we help Riders and Drivers communicate with one another to arrange a pickup, we do not share your actual phone number or other contact information with other users. If you report a lost or found item to us, we will seek to connect you with the relevant Rider or Driver, including sharing actual contact information with your consent.

Shared Ride Riders. When Riders use a Lyft Shared ride, we share each Riderï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s name and profile picture to ensure safety. Riders may also see each otherï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s pickup and drop-off locations as part of knowing the route while sharing the ride.

Rides Requested or Paitake may be requested or paid for by others. If you take one of those rides using your Lyft Business Profile account, a code or coupon, a corporate credit card linked to another account, or another user otherwise requests a ride for you, we may share some or all of your ride details with that other party, including the date, time, charge, rating given, region of trip, and pick up and drop off location of your ride.

Referral Programs. If you refer someone to the Lyft Platform, we will let them know that you generated the referral. If another user referred you, we may share information about your use of the Lyft Platform with that user. For example, a referral source may receive a bonus when you join the Lyft Platform or complete a certain number of rides and would receive such information.

How and when we share information
Anyone can see the public boards and Pins you create and profile information you give us. We also make this public information available through what are called APIs (basically a technical way to share information quickly). For example, a partner can study what their most popular Pins are or how their Pins are being shared on Pinterest by using a Pinterest API. We also share your information with:

Other services, at your direction, to enable you to sign up for or log in to Pinterest, or when you decide to link your Pinterest account to those services, like Facebook or Google, or when you publish your content on Pinterest to them. For example, if you choose to publish your Pins to Facebook or Twitter, then information about that content will be shared with Facebook or Twitter.
Services we use to market Pinterest to you on sites and apps other than Pinterest, such as Facebook Ads, Google Marketing Platform, Microsoft Advertising, LinkedIn Advertising, The Trade Desk and others from time to time. You can opt-out of sharing with such advertising services in your settings.
Online advertisers and third-party companies that we or they use to audit or improve the delivery and performance of ads or content on websites and apps (for example, through Google Analytics).

Learn more about how we share information with online advertisers. To learn more about third-party companies that analyze ad performance, please visit our Help Center.
Third-party companies, service providers or individuals that we employ to process information on our behalf based on our instructions and for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

Law enforcement agencies or government agencies. We only share information if we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety, rights, or property of the public, any person, or Pinterest; or to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.
Our wholly-owned subsidiaries and affiliates. If we were to engage in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, or similar transaction or proceeding that involves the transfer of the information described in this Policy, we would share your information with a party involved in such a process (for example, a potential purchaser).

We keep your information only so long as we need it to provide Pinterest to you and fulfill the purposes described in this policy. This is also the case for anyone that we share your information with and who carries out services on our behalf. When we no longer need to use your information and there is no need for us to keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ll either remove it from our systems or depersonalize it so that we can't identify you.

II. How do we use this information?
We use the information we have (subject to choices you make) as described below and to provide and support the Facebook Products and related services described in the Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms. Here's how:
Provide, personalize and improve our Products.
We use the information we have to deliver our Products, including to personalize features and content (including your News Feed, Instagram Feed, Instagram Stories and ads) and make suggestions for you (such as groups or events you may be interested in or topics you may want to follow) on and off our Products. To create personalized Products that are unique and relevant to you, we use your connections, preferences, interests and activities based on the data we collect and learn from you and others (including any data with special protections you choose to provide); how you use and interact with our Products; and the people, places, or things you're connected to and interested in on and off our Products.

Information across Facebook Products and devices: We connect information about your activities on different Facebook Products and devices to provide a more tailored and consistent experience on all Facebook Products you use, wherever you use them. For example, we can suggest that you join a group on Facebook that includes people you follow on Instagram or communicate with using Messenger. We can also make your experience more seamless, for example, by automatically filling in your registration information (such as your phone number) from one Facebook Product when you sign up for an account on a different Product.
Location-related information: We use location-related information-such as your current location, where you live, the places you like to go, and the businesses and people you're near-to provide, personalize and improve our Products, including ads, for you and others.

Product research and development: We use the information we have to develop, test and improve our Products, including by conducting surveys and research, and testing and troubleshooting new products and features.
Face recognition: If you have it turned on, we use face recognition technology to recognize you in photos, videos and camera experiences.

Learn more about how we use face recognition technology, or control our use of this technology in Facebook Settings. If we introduce face-recognition technology to your Instagram experience, we will let you know first, and you will have control over whether we use this technology for you.

Learn more about how we select and personalize ads, and your choices over the data we use to select ads and other sponsored content for you in the Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.

Promote safety, integrity and security.
We use the information we have to verify accounts and activity, combat harmful conduct, detect and prevent spam and other bad experiences, maintain the integrity of our Products, and promote safety and security on and off of Facebook Products.

Research and innovate for social good.

III. How is this information shared?
Your information is shared with others in the following ways:
Sharing on Facebook Products
People and accounts you share and communicate with
When you share and communicate using our Products, you choose the audience for what you share. For example, when you post on Facebook, you select the audience for the post, such as a group, all of your friends, the public, or a customized list of people. Similarly, when you use Messenger or Instagram to communicate with people or businesses, those people and businesses can see the content you send. Your network can also see actions you have taken on our Products, including engagement with ads and sponsored content. We also let other accounts see who has viewed their Facebook or Instagram Stories.
Public information can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products, including if they don't have an account. This includes your Instagram username; any information you share with a public audience; information in your public profile on Facebook; and content you share on a Facebook Page, public Instagram account or any other public forum, such as Facebook Marketplace. You, other people using Facebook and Instagram, and we can provide access to or send public information to anyone on or off our Products, including in other Facebook Company Products, in search results, or through tools and APIs. Public information can also be seen, accessed, reshared or downloaded through third-party services such as search engines, APIs, and offline media such as TV, and by apps, websites and other services that integrate with our Products.
Learn more about what information is public and how to control your visibility on Facebook and Instagram.
Content others share or reshare about you
You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who can see your activity on our Products can choose to share it with others on and off our Products, including people and businesses outside the audience you shared with. For example, when you share a post or send a message to specific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot, or reshare that content to others across or off our Products, in person or in virtual reality experiences such as Facebook Spaces. Also, when you comment on someone else's post or react to their content, your comment or reaction is visible to anyone who can see the other person's content, and that person can change the audience later.
People can also use our Products to create and share content about you with the audience they choose. For example, people can share a photo of you in a Story, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share information about you in their posts or messages. If you are uncomfortable with what others have shared about you on our Products, you can learn how to report the content.
Information about your active status or presence on our Products.
People in your networks can see signals telling them whether you are active on our Products, including whether you are currently active on Instagram, Messenger or Facebook, or when you last used our Products.
Apps, websites, and third-party integrations on or using our Products.
When you choose to use third-party apps, websites, or other services that use, or are integrated with, our Products, they can receive information about what you post or share. For example, when you play a game with your Facebook friends or use a Facebook Comment or Share button on a website, the game developer or website can receive information about your activities in the game or receive a comment or link that you share from the website on Facebook. Also, when you download or use such third-party services, they can access your public profile on Facebook, and any information that you share with them. Apps and websites you use may receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose to share it with them. But apps and websites you use will not be able to receive any other information about your Facebook friends from you, or information about any of your Instagram followers (although your friends and followers may, of course, choose to share this information themselves). Information collected by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not this one.
Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our own first-party apps) will have access to all information you choose to share with them, including information your friends share with you, so they can provide our core functionality to you.
Note: We are in the process of restricting developersï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ data access even further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will remove developers' access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their  months, and we are changing Login, so that in the next version, we will reduce the data that an app can request without app review to include only name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email address. Requesting any other data will require our approval.
New owner.
If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets changes, we may transfer your information to the new owner.

We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our Products or who use Facebook Business Tools to grow their businesses, which makes it possible to operate our companies and provide free services to people around the world. We don't sell any of your information to anyone, and we never will. We also impose strict restrictions on how our partners can use and disclose the data we provide. Here are the types of third parties we share information with:
Partners who use our analytics services.
We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and businesses understand how people are engaging with their posts, listings, Pages, videos and other content on and off the Facebook Products. For example, Page admins and Instagram business profiles receive information about the number of people or accounts who viewed, reacted to, or commented on their posts, as well as aggregate demographic and other information that helps them understand interactions with their Page or account.
Advertisers.
We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads and how their ads are performing, but we don't share information that personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us permission. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We also confirm which Facebook ads led you to make a purchase or take an action with an advertiser.
Measurement partners.
We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide analytics and measurement reports to our partners.
Partners offering goods and services in our Products.
When you subscribe to receive premium content, or buy something from a seller in our Products, the content creator or seller can receive your public information and other information you share with them, as well as the information needed to complete the transaction, including shipping and contact details.
Vendors and service providers.
We provide information and content to vendors and service providers who support our business, such as by providing technical infrastructure services, analyzing how our Products are used, providing customer service, facilitating payments or conducting surveys.
Researchers and academics.
We also provide information and content to research partners and academics to conduct research that advances scholarship and innovation that support our business or mission, and enhances discovery and innovation on topics of general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and well-being.
Law enforcement or legal requests.
We share information with law enforcement or in response to legal requests in the circumstances outlined below.
Learn more about how you can control the information about you that you or others share with third-party partners in the Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.


IV. How do the Facebook Companies work together?
Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other Facebook Companies (which include WhatsApp and Oculus) to provide an innovative, relevant, consistent and safe experience across all Facebook Company Products you use. We also process information about you across the Facebook Companies for these purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their terms and policies. For example, we process information from WhatsApp about accounts sending spam on its service so we can take appropriate action against those accounts on Facebook, Instagram or Messenger. We also work to understand how people use and interact with Facebook Company Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on different Facebook Company Products.


V. How can I manage or delete information about me?
We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and erase your data. Learn more in your Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.
We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Facebook Products, or until your account is deleted - whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected and processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you search for something on Facebook, you can access and delete that query from within your search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after 6 months. If you submit a copy of your government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete that copy 30 days after review, unless otherwise stated. Learn more about deletion of content you have shared and cookie data obtained through social plugins.
When you delete your account, we delete things you have posted, such as your photos and status updates, and you won't be able to recover that information later. Information that others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted. If you don't want to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you can deactivate your account instead. To delete your account at any time, please visit the Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.


VI. How do we respond to legal requests or prevent harm?
We access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or others:
In response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States when we have a good-faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards.
When we have a good-faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud, unauthorized use of the Products, violations of our terms or policies, or other harmful or illegal activity; to protect ourselves (including our rights, property or Products), you or others, including as part of investigations or regulatory inquiries; or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. For example, if relevant, we provide information to and receive information from third-party partners about the reliability of your account to prevent fraud, abuse and other harmful activity on and off our Products.
Information we receive about you (including financial transaction data related to purchases made with Facebook) can be accessed and preserved for an extended period when it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations of possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also retain information from accounts disabled for terms violations for at least a year to prevent repeat abuse or other term violations.


VII. How do we operate and transfer data as part of our global services?
We share information globally, both internally within the Facebook Companies, and externally with our partners and with those you connect and share with around the world in accordance with this policy. Your information may, for example, be transferred or transmitted to, or stored and processed in the United States or other countries outside of where you live for the purposes as described in this policy. These data transfers are necessary to provide the services set forth in the Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms and to globally operate and provide our Products to you. We utilize standard contract clauses, rely on the European Commission's adequacy decisions about certain countries, as applicable, and obtain your consent for these data transfers to the United States and other countries.


VIII. How will we notify you of changes to this policy?
We'll notify you before we make changes to this policy and give you the opportunity to review the revised policy before you choose to continue using our Products.",1

SNAP,https://snap.com/en-US/privacy/privacy-policy,"Privacy Policy
Effective: September 14, 2020

Snap Inc. is a camera company. Our products and servicesï¿½ï¿½ï¿½including Snapchat, Bitmoji, Spectacles, advertising, and others that link to this Privacy Policyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½provide fast and fun ways to express yourself, live in the moment, learn about the world, and have fun together!

When you use these services, youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ll share some information with us. So we want to be upfront about the information we collect, how we use it, whom we share it with, and the controls we give you to access, update, and delete your information.

Thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s why weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve written this Privacy Policy. And itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s why weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve tried to write it in a way thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s blissfully free of the legalese that often clouds these documents. Of course, if you still have questions about anything in our Privacy Policy, just contact us.

You should read our entire Privacy Policy, but when you only have a few minutes or want to remember something later on, you can always take ast a few minutes.

Information We Collect
There are three basic categories of information we collect:

Information you provide.

Information we get when you use our services.

Information we get from third parties.

Hereï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s a little more detail on each of these categories.

Information You Provide
When you interact with our services, we collect information that you provide to us. For example, most of our services require you to set up a Snapchat account, so we need to collect a few important details about you, such as your name, username, password, email address, phone number, and date of birth. We may also ask you to provide us with some additional information that will be publicly visible on our services, such as a profile picture or Bitmoji avatar. Other services, such as commerce products, may require you to provide us with a debit or credit card number and its associated account information.

Of course, youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ll also provide us whatever information you send through our services, such as Snapp in mind that the users who view your Snaps, Chats, and any other content can always save that content or copy it outside the app. So, the same common sense that applies to the internet at large applies to Snapchat as well: Donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t send messages or share content that you wouldnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t want someone to save or share.

When you contact customer support or communicate with us in any other way, weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ll collect whatever information you volunteer or that we need to resolve your question.

Information We Get When You Use Our Services
When you use our services, we collect information about which of those services youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve used and how youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve used them. We might know, for instance, that you watched a particular Story, saw a specific ad for a certain period of time, and sent a few Snaps. Hereï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s a fuller explanation of the types of information we collect when you use our services:

Usage Information. We collect information about your activity through our services. For example, we mayth our services, such as which filters you view or apply to Snaps, which Stories you watch on Discover, whether youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re using Spectacles, or which search queries you submit.

how you communicate with other Snapchatters, such as their names, the time and date of your communications, the number of messages you exchange with your friends, which friends you exchange messages with the most, and your interactions with messages (such as when you open a message or capture a screenshot).

Content Information. We collect content you create on our services, such as custom stickers, and information about the content you create or provide, such as if the recipient has viewed the content and the metadata that is provided with the content.

Device Information. We collect information from and about the devices you use. For example, we collect:

information about your hardware and software, such as the hardware model, operating system version, device memory, advertising identifiers, unique application identifiers, appsed, unique device identifiers, browser type, language, battery level, and time zone;

information from device sensors, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, compasses, microphones, and whether you have headphones connected; and

information about your wireless and mobile network connections, such as mobile phone number, service provider, IP address, and signal strength.

Device Phonebook. Because Snapchat is all about communicating with friends, we mayï¿½ï¿½ï¿½with your permissionï¿½ï¿½ï¿½collect information from your deviceï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s phonebook.

Camera and Photos. Many of our services require us to collect images and other information from your deviceï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s camera and photos. For example, you wonï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t be able to send Snaps or upload photos from your camera roll unless we can access your camera or photos.

Location Information. When you use our services we may collect information about your location. With your permission, we may also collect information about your precise location using methods that ins, Wi-Fi access points, and other sensors, such as gyroscopes, accelerometers, and compasses.

Information Collected by Cookies and Other Technologies. Like most online services and mobile applications, we may use cookies and other technologies, such as web beacons, web storage, and unique advertising identifiers, to collect information about your activity, browser, and device. We may also use these technologies to collect information when you interact with services we offer through one of our partners, such as advertising and commerce features. For example, we may use information collected on other websites to show you more relevant ads. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually remove or reject browser cookies through the settings on your browser or device. Keep in mind, though, that removing or rejecting cookies could affect the availability and functionality of our services. To learn more about how we and our partners use cookies on our services and your choices, please check out our Cookie Policy.

Log Information. We also collect log information when you use our website, such as:

details about how youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve used our services;

device information, such as your web browser type and language;

access times;

pages viewed;

IP address;

identifiers associated with cookies or other technologies that may uniquely identify your device or browser; and

pages you visited before or after navigating to our website.

Information We Collect from Third Parties
We may collect information about you from other users, our affiliates, and third parties. Here are a few examples:

If you link your Snapchat account to another service (like Bitmoji or a third-party app), we may receive information from the other service, like how you use that service.

Advertisers, app developers, publishers, and other third parties may share information with us as well. We may use this information, among other ways, to help target or measure the performance of ads. You can learn more about our uis kind of third-party data in our Support Center.

If another user uploads their contact list, we may combine information from that userï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s contact list with other information we have collected about you.

How We Share Information
We may share information about you in the following ways:

information about how you have interacted with our services, such as your Snapchat ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½score,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ the names of Snapchatters you are friends with, and other information that will help Snapchatters understand your connections with others using our services. For example, because it may not be clear whether a new friend request comes from someone you actually know, we may share whether you and the requestor have Snapchat friends in common.

any additional information you have directed us to share. For example, Snap will share your information when you connect your Snapchat account to a third-party app, and if you share information or co-party app.

content you post or send. How widely your content is shared depends on your personal settings and the type of service you are using. For example, a Snap may be sent to just a single friend you select, but your My Story content may be seen by any Snapchatter whom you allow to see your My Story.

With all Snapchatters, our business partners, and the general public. We may share the following information with all Snapchatters as well as with our business partners and the general public:

public information like your name, username, Snapcode and profile pictures.

Story submissions that are set to be viewable by Everyone and any content that you submit to an inherently public service, like Our Story and other crowd-sourced services.

With our affiliates. We may share information with entities within the Snap Inc. family of companies.

Third-Party Content and Integrations

Through these integrations, you may be providing information to the third party as well as to Snap. We are not responsible for how those third parties collect or use your information. As always, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of every third-party service that you visit or use, including those third parties you interact with through our services.

How Long We Keep Your Information
Snapchat lets you capture what itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s like to live in the moment. On our end, that means most messagesï¿½ï¿½ï¿½like Snaps and Chatsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½sent in Snapchat will be automatically deleted by default from our servers after we detect theyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve been opened by all recipients or have expired. Other content, like Story posts, are stored for longer. For detailed information about how long we store different types of content, check out our Support Site.

We store other information for longer periods of time. For example:

We store your basic account informationï¿½ï¿½ï¿½like your name, phone number, and email addressï¿½ï¿½ï¿½and list of friends until you ask us to delete them.

We store location information for different lengths of time based on how precise it is and which servi store information about your favorite places for up to 40 days so we can personalize and improve your experience. If location information is associated with a Snapï¿½ï¿½ï¿½like those saved to Memories or posted to Our Storyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ll retain that location as long as we store the Snap.

Weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re constantly collecting and updating information about the things you might like and dislike, so we can provide you with more relevant content and advertisements. Go here to learn more.

If you ever decide to stop using Snapchat, you can just ask us to delete your account. Weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ll also delete most of the information weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve collected about you after youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve been inactive for a whileï¿½ï¿½ï¿½but donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t worry, weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ll try to contact you first!

Keep in mind that, while our systems are designed to carry out our deletion practices automatically, we cannot promise that deletion will occur within a specific timeframe. There may be legal requirements to store your data and we mayng us to preserve content, if we receive reports of abuse or other Terms of Service violations, or if your account or content created by you is flagged by our automated systems for abuse or other Terms of Service violations. Finally, we may also retain certain information in backup for a limited period of time or as required by law.

Control Over Your Information
We want you to be in control of your information, so we provide you with the following tools.

Access, Correction, and Portability. You can access and edit most of your basic account information right in our apps. You can also use Download My Data to obtain a copy of information that isnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t available in our apps in a portable format, so you can move it or store it wherever you want. Because your privacy is important to us, we will ask you to verify your identity or provide additional information before we let you access or update your personal information. We may also reject your request to access or update your personal information for a numbasons, including, for example, if the request risks the privacy of other users or is unlawful.

Revoking permissions. In most cases, if you let us use your information, you can simply revoke your permission by changing the settings in the app or on your device if your device offers those options. Of course, if you do that, certain services may lose full functionality.

Deletion. While we hope youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ll remain a lifelong Snapchatter, if for some reason you ever want to delete your account, just go here to learn how. You can also delete some information in the app, like photos youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve saved to Memories, Our Story submissions, and search history.

Advertising Preferences. We try to show you ads that we think will be relevant to your interests. If you would like to modify the information we and our advertising partners use to select these ads, you can do so in the app and through your device preferences. Go here to learn more.

Communicating with other Snapchatters. Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s important to us that ywhom you communicate with. Thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s why weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve built a number of tools in Settings that let you indicate, among other things, who you want to see your Stories, whether youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½d like to receive Snaps from just your friends or all Snapchatters, and whether youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½d like to block another Snapchatter from contacting you again. Go here to learn more.

Legitimate interest. Another reason we might use your information is because we haveï¿½ï¿½ï¿½or a third party hasï¿½ï¿½ï¿½a legitimate interest in doing so. For example, we need to use your information to provide and improve our services, including protecting your account, delivering your Snaps, providing customer support, and helping you find friends and content we think youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ll like. Because most of our services are free, we also use some information about you to try and show you ads youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ll find interesting. An important point to understand about legitimate interest is that our interests donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t outweigh your right to privacy, so we only rely on legitimate interest when we think thly impact your privacy or would be expected by you, or there is a compelling reason to do so. We explain our legitimate business reasons for using your information in more detail here.
