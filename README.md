## Process

* I will be using the SMS Spam Collection Dataset which tags 5,574 text messages based on whether they are “spam” or “ham” (not spam).
* Build a classification model using Naive Bayes Classifier to classify which texts are spam.
* I used Naive Bayes Classifier because they are popular statistical technique for e-mail filtering.
* Turned the spam message classifier model into a web application using FLASK
